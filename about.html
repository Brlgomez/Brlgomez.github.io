				    	<p>Hello, I am Brandon Gomez,  a senior game design major at UCSC. Video games have been my passion since I first picked up Legos when I was an adolescent. I love to make games that are abstract,  beautiful, unique and have a lasting impression on the player. In the Game-Design major, I get to explore a whole range of topics, for example: story design, art design, artificial intelligence, and game mechanics. The story design class that I took focused on interactive narrative. In that class, we focused on ways narrative can be unique and interactive; our main focus was to make procedural stories that would expand to many different storylines. The classes that I took with a focus in art design were classical music, Indian music, computer modeling, and theater design. The music classes made me have a wider music palette, the theater class allowed me view the set of video games in the same fashion as a play, and I learned how to create professional 3D art assets for games in the computer modeling class. The artificial intelligence course that I have taken was AI in video games. This class taught me how to give intelligence to characters not controlled by the player, giving them the ability to act on their own. Lastly, the game mechanics courses helped broaden my skills to make unique rule sets in games that will amaze people. I have been able to use these skills to make full-scale video games on my free time. During the summer, I was able to make game models, music score, and game mechanics in my upcoming game.</p>
