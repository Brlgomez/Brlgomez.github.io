	<p>Hello, I am Brandon Gomez, I am currently a senior game design major at UCSC. Video games and art have been my passion since I have playing with Legos when I was adolescent. I love to make games that are more in the abstract, unconventional side of things and I always try to make each one of my games have an individuality by having both different aesthetics and gameplay. I strive to make my games beautiful, unique and have a lasting impression on the player. </p>
	<p>I am interested in becoming a gameplay programmer and an insight for the overall art direction for the project.</p>
